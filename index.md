<!-- ## About -->

Hi! :wave: I'm Ben.

I'm an incoming PhD student in Economics at Stanford GSB, starting in September 2024. 

I'm broadly interested in industrial organization, urban and environmental economics, and econometrics.

Previously, I was a predoctoral fellow in economics at [SIEPR](https://siepr.stanford.edu/), and a data scientist at [QuantCo](https://quantco.com/). 

I hold a master's degree in statistics from Oxford, and a bachelor's degree in applied mathematics from Harvard.
